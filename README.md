An application to perform commands for real-life activities. "Sudo - get me a sandwich" Makes an order to your favorite sandwich shop for your favorite sandwich on GrubHub and does all of the payment and delivery options so that the user does not need to confirm on their phones, they just get a success or fail response on their watches. However, if that information isn't pre-configured, then it will open in the phone so the user can fill out the rest of the information they may need.
